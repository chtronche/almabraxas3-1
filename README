This is the software for the Almabraxas 3.1 USV (Unmanned Surface
Vehicle, but I prefer roboat).

The modules:
  
* alma_clock: the all-important clock.

* commander: interpret the commands sent through communication
  channels (serial link on the bench, radio at test "facilities",
  satellite in the field).

* reporting: various logging services to log on the SD card, through
  serial, radio and satellite channels. Please note that the set of
  reported data vary among channels (and the frequency of course). For
  example, the available voltage / current is of little use when in
  the field.

* powerManager: determine the available power.

* nav: use the position to determine the heading.

* helmsman: use the data from powerManager and nav to set the power on
  the two motors.

* wiring.h: where are each signals.

* Utilities:
  ** sd: write to the SD card, mostly for logging. The navplans also
       are on the SD card.
  ** adebug: light the LEDs to see what's going on while on the bench.
  ** NVStore: store parameters in the MCU non volatile memories,
        mostly the software parameters.
  ** ping: command sent by the other side on radio channel to check RSSI.
  ** utils: various utilities

* lib: directory with external libraries.
